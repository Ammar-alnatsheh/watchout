# watchout
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.


As a software engineer, one of the most powerful skills you can learn is how to elegantly and efficiently navigate uncertain terrain.

During your own projects (and on the job), a clear set of steps will rarely be provided. Often, you'll be given a vague goal, and your job will be to discover which tools you need, learn how to use them, and then chart a clear path to an MVP on your own.

The browser is a huge ecosystem with lots of capabilities that we haven't explored yet. This sprint is an introduction to a few of them. In this repo, you'll build a game called Watchout using d3.

95% (at least) of the code you write will depend on external modules and libraries, the majority of which are poorly documented. D3's documentation isn't bad, but there's a lot of it. You'll need to sort through the mountains of documentation and examples to learn what you'll need for this sprint. Exposing you to this is one of the main goals of this sprint.

You'll be working with a reference implementation. In order to ensure that you actually learn the techniques involved, you'll build several intermediate steps along the way. Don't skip these steps. Your code will end up with a different structure than the reference material, but you may be able to refer back to it in order to see how specific features were implemented.

Heads up, don't waste your time trying to reverse engineer the reference code exactly, the game is written in coffeescript and not particularly elegant. If you try to copy it exactly, you're gonna have a bad time. Your goal is to make a game that looks and functions like the reference implementation on the outside. Your code will end up being much more elegant than the code provided on the reference site.

d3's API is very well designed. As you learn it, pay attention to the choices the implementors made. Many similar libraries were written years earlier, but this one achieved a lot of success relatively late in the game because of the design choices made by its implementors. Many such libraries remain to be written. When you write code, pay attention to things that are painful and repetitive, and how you might improve those processes.

Don't resist this non-traditional use of d3. If you make it through the bare minimum requirements you will have an opportunity to use d3 for more traditional data visualization. In the meantime, appreciate that much software can be utilized in creative ways, and refamiliarize yourself if necessary with the learning objectives for this sprint (see above.)
